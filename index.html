        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hello!
            <br>
            My name is Sofia Choi, I am a third-year design student at Western Washington University. I am a passionate
            learner, I love to experiment and try new things in both design and in my hobbies.
            I am primarily interested in typography, printed materials, and web design.
            <br>
            I spend a lot of my time finding new websites to explore. I am interested in the concept of a handmade web
            and websites as architecture. Websites are spaces we occupy, their structure dictates the ways we interact
            with their infrastructure and conduct ourselves within them. Their architecture should be constructed with
            users in mind. The internet is alive, it has been built and sustained on the love, labor, and curiosity of
            millions. I dream of an internet belonging to the peopleâ€“beautiful, intimate, and human-centered. I hope my
            work can contribute to the creation of this world and proliferation of information to the public.
